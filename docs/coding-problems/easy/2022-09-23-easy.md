*You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last `N` `order` ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:*

- `record(order_id)`: adds the order_id to the log
- `get_last(i)`: gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

*You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.*
