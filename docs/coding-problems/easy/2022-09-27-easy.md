*Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.*

*For example, given `A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10` and `B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10`, return the node with value `8`.*

*In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.*

*Do this in `O(M + N)` time (where `M` and `N` are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.*
