### Problem:
*A builder is looking to build a row of `N` houses that can be of `K` different colors. He has a goal of minimizing cost while ensuring that no two neighboring houses are of the same color.*

*Given an `N` by `K` matrix where the `nth` row and `kth` column represents the cost to build the `nth` house with `kth` color, return the minimum cost which achieves this goal.*

### Proposed solution:
```TBD```
